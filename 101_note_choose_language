Next, use the FabCar applications to interact with the deployed FabCar contract.
The FabCar applications are available in multiple programming languages.
Follow the instructions for the programming language of your choice:

JavaScript:

  Start by changing into the "javascript" directory:
    cd javascript

  Next, install all required packages:
    npm install

  Then run the following applications to enroll the admin user, and register a new user
  called user1 which will be used by the other applications to interact with the deployed
  FabCar contract:
    node enrollAdmin
    node registerUser

  You can run the invoke application as follows. By default, the invoke application will
  create a new car, but you can update the application to submit other transactions:
    node invoke

  You can run the query application as follows. By default, the query application will
  return all cars, but you can update the application to evaluate other transactions:
    node query

TypeScript:

  Start by changing into the "typescript" directory:
    cd typescript

  Next, install all required packages:
    npm install

  Next, compile the TypeScript code into JavaScript:
    npm run build

  Then run the following applications to enroll the admin user, and register a new user
  called user1 which will be used by the other applications to interact with the deployed
  FabCar contract:
    node dist/enrollAdmin
    node dist/registerUser

  You can run the invoke application as follows. By default, the invoke application will
  create a new car, but you can update the application to submit other transactions:
    node dist/invoke

  You can run the query application as follows. By default, the query application will
  return all cars, but you can update the application to evaluate other transactions:
    node dist/query

Java:

  Start by changing into the "java" directory:
    cd java

  Then, install dependencies and run the test using:
    mvn test

  The test will invoke the sample client app which perform the following:
    - Enroll admin and user1 and import them into the wallet (if they don't already exist there)
    - Submit a transaction to create a new car
    - Evaluate a transaction (query) to return details of this car
    - Submit a transaction to change the owner of this car
    - Evaluate a transaction (query) to return the updated details of this car
